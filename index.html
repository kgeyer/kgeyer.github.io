	<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics at
		Boston University, and advised by Joshua Campbell and Masanao Yajima.
		Our research focuses on develop of statistical methology for scientific 
		discovery from genomic data. 
	<p>Before graduate school, I was a staff member at MIT Lincoln Laboratory 
		for four years, where I developed tools for text analytics and signal 
		processing. My current (and former) research interests include,
		<ul>
			<li>Topic modeling with Bayesian hierarchical models & autoencoders</li>
			<li>High dimensional statistics & convex optimization</li>
			<li>Over-parameterization in deep learning & matrix sensing</li>
			<li>Signal processing & analytics of unstructured text data</li>
		</ul>
